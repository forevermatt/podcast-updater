# Podcast Updater
TypeScript / JavaScript files to read a webpage of links to audio files and
generate a podcast XML file from that information.

## TODO

* Assemble podcast XML data.
* Correct the format of the date strings used in the XML.
* If necessary, try using https://github.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata to get the
  mp3 files' duration.
