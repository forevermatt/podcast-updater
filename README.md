# Podcast Updater
TypeScript / JavaScript files to read a webpage of links to audio files and
generate a podcast XML file from that information.

## TODO

* Assemble podcast XML data.
* If necessary, try using https://github.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata to get the
  mp3 files' duration.
* Try using https://www.npmjs.com/package/js2xmlparser to convert that data to
  an XML string.
