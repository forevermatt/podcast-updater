# Podcast Updater
TypeScript / JavaScript files to read a webpage of links to audio files and
generate a podcast XML file from that information.

## TODO

* Assemble podcast XML data.
* Get the size (in Bytes) of the mp3 files (perhaps via the HTTP response
  headers for any such headers we've not received yet).
* If necessary, try using https://github.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata to get the
  mp3 files' duration.
